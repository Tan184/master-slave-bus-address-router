# master-slave-bus-address-router
A Verilog-based bus routing module that connects one master to multiple slaves using address-based decoding logic. Includes a modular SystemVerilog testbench (driver, monitor, scoreboard, etc.) to verify correct routing and functionality across defined address ranges.


Done with the top level module, and a full blown SystemVerilog testbench with a monitor, scoreboard, generator, driver, env, and transaction classes.

Gonna try making the slaves AMBA APB compliant now!
