# master-slave-bus-address-router
A Verilog-based bus routing module that connects one master to multiple slaves using address-based decoding logic. Includes a modular SystemVerilog testbench (driver, monitor, scoreboard, etc.) to verify correct routing and functionality across defined address ranges.


Currently working on the top-level module and its testbench, I'll update the README with waveforms and block diagrams after I'm done with that :)
